Grid Knight is a game of avoidance. Four mice will spawn randomly from the outter perimiters of the canvas.The goal of the player is to avoid collision with the mice. When the player contacts 
any particular mouse, the game is a loss. 
Currently, the game lacks collision mechanics. There are plans to implement a time keeping scoreboard, which will reward the player based on their survival time. 
There are also plans to increase the speed of the mice as time progresses.
