Tea party is a game of drag and drop creativity utilizing JQuery draggable elements. Simply click and drag elements on the page to move them about. 
This game is a placeholder for an evolved version of itself. In the future, Tea Party will be replaced with a drag and drop chess game, including a board and pieces. 
Tea party is a completed game as it is, and will not be receiving any further updates.
